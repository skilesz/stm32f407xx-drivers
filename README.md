# stm32f407xx-drivers    

This project is my attempt at writing drivers for different peripherals connected to the STM32F407xx family of microcontrollers. To use any and all drivers, make sure to put `#include "stm32f407.h"` at the top of your `main.c` file and include any relevant driver files in your `src` and `inc` folders.
